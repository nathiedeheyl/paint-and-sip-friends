## Design 

### Fonts

Fonts were imported from: https://fonts.google.com/. As a heading font, _Delius Unicase_ brings an artistic, quirky allure, while _Quicksand_, a modern sans-serif font, is used for the body to ensure readability while maintaining a playful appearance. 

[Back to Table of Contents](https://github.com/nathiedeheyl/paint-and-sip-friends/blob/main/README.md#tabel-of-contents)

### Colors and Contrast 

+ **Primary colors:** The main colors the focus lies on are: #eac5a9 for the background of e. g. header and footer; and #393434 as body text color for it's soft contrast that fits the general pastel allure of the website. 

+ **Secondary colors:** The general background color of the website is #f5e5dc which fits the pastel vibe of the website and aligns the richer primary shades. </br>
To complement the primary colors and soft beige background color of the website, a soft, but dark green was chosen to create enough contrast in elements like the jump-btns without disturbing the aestetics: #f5e5dc. 

+ **Contrast:** To ensure enough contrast ratio was given, the Chrome dev tools were used mostly, as well as https://pagespeed.web.dev/. 

## Features 

### Home page 

+ A sticky header with toggle down menu for smaller devices appears on all pages. It opens by clicking the three dots icon on the right side of the header. On larger devices (from 768px), the #menu appears in a horizontal line, styled with flexbox. </br>
    <details>

    ![Responsive Header](assets/images/screenshot-features-1.png)</br>

    ![Toggle down menu on mobile devices](assets/images/screenshot-features-2.png)
    </details></br>

+ A button of class="jump-btn" in the hero section guides mobile users to the next section (#about). The button is reused between the #about and #motivation sections, ensuring smooth navigation through the homepage content.

    ![Jump-to-Motivation Button](assets/images/screenshot-features-button-2.png)
    </details></br>

+ In the #motivation and #link section, Bootstrap's colums system and cards create a responsive and visually appealing structure.

+ The two link cards in the #link section redirect to the Blog page and Get-in-touch pages, using buttons styled like the previous jump-btn.

    </details></br>

+ Font Awesome social media icons are in the footer. Pinterest replaces the commonly used Twitter/X icon, as it better fits the website's context.

    ![Social media icons in Footer](assets/images/screenshot-features-footer.png)</br>

    </details></br>

### Blog page

+ In addition to the sticky header, a fixed navigation bar was added for the blog page to help users navigate through different sections (Tools, Projects, Meetup times). These sections are expected to grow over time, justifying the extra navigation bar, which is styled slimmer for larger devices (from 768px). 

    <details>
    <summary>Additional navigation bar on Blog page</summary>

    ![Responsiveness of additional navbar](assets/images/screenshot-features-fixed-nav-2.png)
    </details></br>

+ A Bootstrap accordion organizes the #tools section, keeping the page uncluttered and focusing the user's attention on other content. 

    (see screenshot above for visual)

+ The #meetup section uses flexbox for a compact display on smaller devices. 

+ The #meetups section includes a call-to-action button guiding users to the contact form page.

    </details></br>

### Get in touch page 

+ A simple, user-friendly contact form with validation, built with regular HTML.

+ The contact form features a matching background image and a submit button, maintaining consistent styling with the rest of the website.

### Bugs

+ After running the https://pagespeed.web.dev/ to access accessability I was prompted to make all links discernible; Research: (https://dequeuniversity.com/rules/axe/4.10/link-name); Added 'aria-labels' to all links, including anchor navigation links. 

+ Nav 'width: 100vh' caused toggled menu to have a max width of 648px. Fixed by adjusting 'width' to 100% instead. 

+ To center the bootstrap cards I had to contact turoring assistance eventually to find out about the "mx-auto" class which centered them on smaller devices below 768px. 

+ Removed margins of 'ul' in all headers to make it take up less space on tablets when hold horizontally. 

+ Used long version of background properties for contact form background image, because shorthand version wouldn't apply the image styling correctly. The long version ensured that the background was displayed properly across all screen sizes.

    ```
    #get-in-touch {
        background-image: url(../images/contact-form-background.webp);
        background-repeat: no-repeat;
        background-position: center center;
        background-size: cover;
    }
    ```

## Changelog 

### Version 1.0.0 (Initial)

+ Made header sticky instead of fixed to integrate it in document flow and remove margins on main content. 

+ Added a button .jump-btn to the hero section that when clicked jumps to the #about section, aimed at guiding mobile users to read all the content of the home page. 

+ Added an empty div between #about and #motivation for anchor navigation in an attempt to prevent to prevent the #about content from sliding under the sticky header that becomes fixed after scrolling. 

+ Added .jump-btn after #about section for the same purpose as above to jump to #motvation section. ~~Removed this button on larger screens to prevent irritation due to unnecessary nativation elements.~~ 

+ Bootstrap accordion instead of original idea of clickable buttons with collapsable text using bootstrap data-bs-parent="". 

+ add a call-to-action button after #meetups section that links to contact-form.html to guide reader to 'Get in Touch' page to contact site owner to obtain Zoom link invitation for virtual events.

+ Added a custom 404.html page with embedded css styling for the purpose of clarity. 

+ Since my main goal is "to inspire and engage users to start or continue painting as a hobby," and most of my target audience is likely to visit the website on a mobile device, I decided to change the layout of the Bootstrap cards in the #about section. I vertically stacked the cards to avoid overwhelming mobile users with too much content in the "Why Paint?" section. On desktop devices, having the cards in a row created an imbalance due to the differing content amounts. I imagine only my more engaged users, the "locals and virtuals," will likely visit the site on a larger screen to explore rather the DIY projects or engage with the blog and it's future features. Therefore, the home page layout is primarily optimized for mobile users.

+ Added a final `.intro-paragraph` style rule to format the content under the #Meetups heading. This class has been created for future use.

+ Removed .hidden-on-large after applying more margin to second jump-btn after #about section, creating more space on larger screens and recreating the necessity of a binding element.

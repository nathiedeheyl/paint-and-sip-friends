To effectively address the needs of my audtience, I have identified three key user groups:

## Design 

### Fonts

Fonts were imported from: https://fonts.google.com/. As a heading font, _Delius Unicase_ brings an artistic, quirky allure, while _Quicksand_, a modern sans-serif font, is used for the body to ensure readability while maintaining a playful appearance. 

[Back to Table of Contents](https://github.com/nathiedeheyl/paint-and-sip-friends/blob/main/README.md#tabel-of-contents)

### Colors and Contrast 

+ **Primary colors:** The main colors the focus lies on are: #eac5a9 for the background of e. g. header and footer; and #393434 as body text color for it's soft contrast that fits the general pastel allure of the website. 

+ **Secondary colors:** The general background color of the website is #f5e5dc which fits the pastel vibe of the website and aligns the richer primary shades. </br>
To complement the primary colors and soft beige background color of the website, a soft, but dark green was chosen to create enough contrast in elements like the jump-btns without disturbing the aestetics: #f5e5dc. 

+ **Contrast:** To ensure enough contrast ratio was given, the Chrome dev tools were used mostly, as well as https://pagespeed.web.dev/. 

## Features 

### Home page 

+ A sticky header with toggle down menu for smaller devices appears on all pages. It opens by clicking the three dots icon on the right side of the header. On larger devices (from 768px), the #menu appears in a horizontal line, styled with flexbox. </br>
    <details>

    ![Responsive Header](assets/images/screenshot-features-1.png)</br>

    ![Toggle down menu on mobile devices](assets/images/screenshot-features-2.png)
    </details></br>

+ A button of class="jump-btn" in the hero section guides mobile users to the next section (#about). The button is reused between the #about and #motivation sections, ensuring smooth navigation through the homepage content.

    ![Jump-to-Motivation Button](assets/images/screenshot-features-button-2.png)
    </details></br>

+ The second .jump-btn is hidden on larger screens from 992px on, as there isn't enough content to justify its presence; users tend to scroll naturally on desktops, making it unnecessary and potentially irritating. 

    <details>
    <summary>Media query for second jump-btn</summary>

    ![Hidden Button on larger screens](assets/images/screenshot-features-button-3.png)</br>

    </details></br>

+ In the #motivation and #link section, Bootstrap's colums system and cards create a responsive and visually appealing structure.

+ The two link cards in the #link section redirect to the Blog page and Get-in-touch pages, using buttons styled like the previous jump-btn.

    <details>

    ![Bootstrap Cards link to other pages](assets/images/screenshot-features-link_cards.png)</br>

    </details></br>

+ Font Awesome social media icons are in the footer. Pinterest replaces the commonly used Twitter/X icon, as it better fits the website's context.

    <summary>Social media icons in Footer</summary>

    ![Social media icons in Footer](assets/images/screenshot-features-footer.png)</br>

    </details></br>

### Blog page

+ In addition to the sticky header, a fixed navigation bar was added for the blog page to help users navigate through different sections (Tools, Projects, Meetup times). These sections are expected to grow over time, justifying the extra navigation bar, which is styled slimmer for larger devices (from 768px). 

    <details>

    ![Responsiveness of additional navbar](assets/images/screenshot-features-fixed-nav-2.png)
    </details></br>

+ A Bootstrap accordion organizes the #tools section, keeping the page uncluttered and focusing the user's attention on other content. 

    (see screenshot above for visual)

+ The #meetup section uses flexbox for a compact display on smaller devices. 

+ The #meetups section includes a call-to-action button guiding users to the contact form page.

    </details></br>

### Get in touch page 

+ A simple, user-friendly contact form with validation, built with regular HTML.

+ The contact form features a matching background image and a submit button, maintaining consistent styling with the rest of the website.

+ ? How to fixe the slide over due to sticky instead of fixed ... as well as for jump to #motivation

nav width: 100vh caused toggled menu to have a max width of 648px. fixed by adjusting width: 100% instead. 

found out about mx-auto for bootstrap cards... 

change in header syntax, since I used h2 for styling purposes. reverted this, made it an h1 with inline style insted. 

Removed margins of ul in header to make it take up less space on tablets where horizontal space is more key. 

#get-in-touch {
    background-image: url(../images/contact-form-background.webp);
    background-repeat: no-repeat;
    background-position: center center;
    background-size: cover;
}

To effectively address the needs of my audtience, I have identified three key user groups:

+ **Virtuals:** Active users who engage with the content from a distance. They are looking for practical resources such as challenges, beginner tips, and motivational content that empowers them to start or continue painting and enhance their skills. They feel as a part of a supportive community. 

+ **Locals:** Individuals who live in the area and are interested in attending meetups. They are motivated to start painting by receiving easy action steps and are primarily focused on finding information about upcoming events. Additionally, they seek engaging content that fosters excitement about participating in friendly gatherings with fellow art enthusiasts.
